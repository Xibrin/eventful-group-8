## Iteration 3 Retrospective
Our team was successful in continuing developing our EventFul application and adding in new user interface features that connect to a user database. We were also able to implement a recommendation algorithm to suggest events to users based on their preferences. 
###Challenges for Iteration 3
1. We had challenges fully implementing our recommendation algorithm to consider the costs and distances of events when developing a schedule for a user.
2. We had difficulty finishing the TicketMaster API 
3. We did not get a chance to make our front-end look a lot more appealing to users

###Plan for Iteration 4
1.We will continue developing the front-end application to offer more links for users to explore and view data
2.We will finish the TicketMaster API and create a merge function to have a large data set of events that users can choose from
3.We will continue developing and testing our algorithm to make sure we can consider costs and distance to offer users an 
optimal schedule of events they can attend to
