# Iteration 1 Retrospective

In iteration 1, we were successful in changing our project idea and deciding to create an Event itinerary that is able to collect user input and create a suggested plan for events that the user can attend to based on location, price, amount of free time, etc.In iteration 1, we were able to decide what APIs were best suited for us to work with and we figured out the documentation in order to help us move forward in advancing our database operations for Iteration 2. We experienced challenges with certain APIs not offering us enough information and complicating the process of authenticating keys for us to use in our application. We also experienced difficulties quickly transitioning to a new project idea and did not have enough time to meet all of our team expectations. For iteration 2, we have simplified the process of assigning tasks to make sure all of our team members are actively making improvements to the app and we have decided to focus on database operations, front-end operations, and algorithmic capabilities. We hope that we are more organizeed and consistent in our efforts to accomplish our next goals for iteration 2.


### Challenges for iteration 1:
1. Finding APIs to work with (we had tried to use Eventbrite only to realize all the features we needed were deprecated)
2. Learning how to get authenticated and how to pass authentications when using APIs (some APIs had difficult authentications
3. Trying to schedule team meetings and getting everyone together to do work
4. Delegation


### Plans for Iteration 2 (How to Improve):
1. Talk to Professor Darvish about team management/task delegation issues.
2. Figure out some kind of organization system / task delegation system.
3. Assign people specific responsibilities for deadlines.
