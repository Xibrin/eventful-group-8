## Iteration 2 Retrospective

Our team was successful in adhering to our new project design idea and fully working on the new tasks. We were able to delegate responsibilities to front-end and back-end development to increase our efficiency and meet our goals for iteration 2. One struggle we had was using both Django rest framework and React as our backend and frontend development tools for the iteration. While both offer an appealing range of services for their designated uses, we decided that we did not need to focus too much of our time on React and instead opted for a simpler front-end user interface for the time being to accomplish the goals for the iteration. However, we were successful in setting up the user and event database, developing methods to parse events from the Yelp API, creating a user-friendly interface the allows a user to sign in and search events, and a better prospective of what our application will look like going forward

###Challenges for Iteration 2
1. We had difficulty incorporating API keys as global variables which resulted in a last minute sharing of a team API key and instructions in the README. We have since figured out this mistake for iteration 3.
2. We had trouble deciding if React was appropriate to use for our front-end development due to the difficulty in linking this application with the Django framework we had already developed
3. We did not have enough time to use the Ticketmaster API to find even more events for users and develop a recommendation algorithm


###Plan for Iteration 3
1. We will incorporate the Ticketmaster API to help expand the number of events presented to users based on the time, location, and date
2. We will begin developing a robust recommendation algorithm that can comprehensively outline events that users can attend to based on their preferences for time, date, and location
3. We will continue developing the front-end application to offer more links for users to explore and view data
4. We will research how to update a database of events each day to consistently offer users the most up-to-date events they can attend to
